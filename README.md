# Pattern Matching for Switch Examples

This repository contains several examples for "Pattern Matching for switch", 
a feature described in [JEP 441](https://openjdk.org/jeps/441) 
and released in [Java 21](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/java-21-features/). 

As long as your favorite IDE does not yet support the new Java version, you can execute each file via the `java` command, for example:

```
cd src/main/java/eu/happycoders/java21/patternmatching
java Example05_SwitchWithTypePattern.java
```

You can download Java 21 from here: https://jdk.java.net/21/

To install multiple Java versions on Linux or macOS, I recommend using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

To install multiple Java versions on Windows, check out my tutorial [How to Change Java Versions in Windows](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/)
