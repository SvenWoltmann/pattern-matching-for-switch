# Pattern Matching for Switch Examples

This repository contains several examples for "Pattern Matching for switch", 
a feature described in [JEP 441](https://openjdk.org/jeps/441) 
and released in [Java 21](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/java-21-features/). 

## Java 21 IDE Support

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) supports Java 21 as of version 2023.2.2.
As long as this version is not yet released, 
you can install the release candidate via the [JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
by going into the IntelliJ IDEA settings and activating the "Early Access Program".

If your favorite IDE does not yet support the new Java version, 
you can run any file via the `java` command, for example:

```
cd src/main/java/eu/happycoders/java21/patternmatching
java Example05_SwitchWithTypePattern.java
```

## Java Downloads

You can download Java 21 from here: https://jdk.java.net/21/

To install multiple Java versions on Linux or macOS, I recommend using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

To install multiple Java versions on Windows, 
have a look at this tutorial: [How to Change Java Versions in Windows](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/)
